          <br />
          My name is Antonio Shivers. I'm a full stack software engineer, I am
          currently a pursuit fellow enrolled in the 8.3 cohort. My interests
          include: Computer programming, playing video games, watching anime and
          cartoons. A long term goal of mine is to transition into video game
          engineering after I have gained more experience as a software
          engineer. If you would like to see some of the stuff I have worked on
          feel free to check out my GitHub!

          My name is Abdullah Tasfiek. I'm a software engineer from the 8.3
          cohort at Pursuit. Other than programming, I enjoy going on hikes,
          weight lifting, and playing video games. I goal of mine is to get a
          work from home software engineering job so I can travel more often. I
          don't want to be a programmer that stays inside all day. I encourage
          software engineers to be more active and adventurous! If you would
          like to know more about me, check out my Github!
